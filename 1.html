<h2>Introduction</h2>
 Computer is an electronic device device derived from the Latin word 
"computere" which means to calculate. It accepts raw facts and figure
s as an input which are isolated and uninterpreted through input device,
 process it according to the requirement of the user or command supplied 
 by the user, store it before and after processing of require and produce
 a meaningful information as an output through an output device. Generally,
 computer works on IPO (Input-Process-Output) cycle. It follows GIGO
 (Garbage In Garbage Out) algorithm which means the output is always based
 on the input supplied by the user. The basic operation of computer is 
 illustrated by following block diagram.

    <h2>Introduction to Computer System</h2>
    <p>The word <strong>system</strong> refers to the integration of several independent units that work together to achieve a common objective or goal. A system is a set of detailed methods, procedures, and routines created to carry out a specific activity, perform a duty, or solve a problem. In a system, different units coordinate with each other to work as a whole. Without any of the units, the entire system is affected.</p>
    
    <p>Similarly, a <strong>computer system</strong> is also a combination of hardware, software, and peripherals that are organized together to run our computer smoothly. Our computer system operates based on the <strong>IPO (Input-Process-Output) cycle</strong>. It is mandatory for different units to work together to convert raw facts and figures into meaningful information. Without any one of these units, the computer starts malfunctioning.</p>

    <p>The design, arrangement, construction, or organization of different parts of a computer system is known as <strong>computer architecture</strong>. It is the conceptual design and fundamental operational structure of a computer system. It is a framework that focuses on how the CPU performs internal operations. So, computer architecture can also be defined as the science and art of selecting and interconnecting hardware components to create a computer that meets functional, performance, and cost requirements.</p>

    <title>Central Processing Unit</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Central Processing Unit</h1>
    <p>The CPU is brain of any computer system. Like in human body, all major decision are taken by the brain. Similarly, in computer all major calculation and comparison are made inside the CPU and CPU is also responsible for activating and controlling the operation of other unit of a computer system. A micro processor is a single chip that performs the function of CPU in micro-computers. The speed of the microprocessor is measured in terms of Megahertz and Gigahertz.</p>
    <h2>The functions of CPU (processor) are:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>To carry out processing.</li>
        <li>To give command and co-ordinate with all other parts of computer system.</li>
        <li>To control the sequence of operation that takes place in our computer system.</li>
        <li>To helps in memory allocation and controls storage of data and instruction.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>The central processing unit consists of unit:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Arithmetic logic Unit (ALU)</li>
        <li>Control Unit (CU)</li>
        <li>Memory Unit (MU)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>ALU: Arithmetic Logic Unit</h3>
    <p>ALU stands for Arithmetic Logic Unit. It is one of the most important unit of processing. Where actual execution of the instruction takes place during processing. It performs arithmetic and logical operations and controls speed of those operations as directed by control unit(CU). To be clear all the calculation and decision are made in ALU. The data and instruction are stored in the primary memory before processing, and are transferred when needed to the ALU.</p>
    <h3>CU: Control Unit</h3>
    <p>Although, control unit doesn't perform any actual processing on the data , it acts as a central nervous system for other component of the computer. It manages and co-ordinate the entire computer system. It obtain instruction from the program stored in the main memory, interprets the instruction accordingly and issue signal that cause other unit of the system to execute them. Basically, it controls overall operation of the computer. It also controls all other device input/output device connected to the CPU. It directs the movement of electrical signal between main memory to ALU and input-output device. Hence, control unit acts as the nerve system of the computer system.</p>
    <h3>MU: Memory Unit</h3>
    <p>Memory unit is responsible for storing data and instruction either for short or longer period of time. Basically memory unit stores data and instruction before and after processing . As we know, memory are needed for program being currently used or to store data and instruction permanently . Depending upon the nature of data stored memory unit are distinguished into primary memory and secondary memory. Memory unit of CPU is a primary memory where data and instruction are stored temporarily. Where as  the processed data and information can be stored in secondary memory permanently so that user can retrieve information whenever required. There are two types of memory used in our computer system.<ol>
   <li>1.  Primary memory/Main memory </li>
   <li>2.  Secondary memory/Auxiliary Memory</li></ol></p>

    <h4>1) Primary Memory/Main Memory</h4>
    <p>Primary Memory is also known as main memory of computer. This is the place where our data and instruction are stored before processing and the result are stored before displaying output. Memory which stores data and information currently being used by the computer is known as primary memory.

<h5>Features of primary memory:</h5>
<ul>
    <li>It is not used to store data permanently.</li>
    <li>It is usually volatile except ROM.</li>
    <li>It is usually expensive and faster than Secondary storage.</li>
    <li>It is normally used for smaller storage.</li>
    <li>It is not used to transfer data from one computer to another computer.</li>
    <li>It is made up of semiconducting material.</li>
</ul>
<h4>2) Secondary Memory/Auxiliary Memory</h4>
    <p>Memory which stores data and information permanently for future reference is known as secondary memory. It is a permanent memory where data and instruction remains forever. It is also known as non-volatile memory in which data and instruction remains even if there is no electric supply. This type of memory is also known as auxiliary memory. It has a huge storage capacity up to Gigabytes, Terabytes or even more. Different secondary storage media used are: Magnetic storage, Optical storage and Flash storage.</p>
    <h2>Classification of computer on the Basis of Size</h2>
    <p>As we know, technological development and precise engineering had drastically reduce the size of computers. Development of various electronic components are the major cause for reducing the size of the computer. Different types of computer on the basis of size are:</p>
    <h3>Super Computer</h3>
    <p>This computer are one of the fastest and powerful digital computer which can perform only a particular types of jobs such as weather forecasting, rocket launching, population counting etc. They were tremendously huge in size and are very expensive. Due to this reason they are not commercially successful. They are used by large corporations and government agencies. They were large in size hence, it occupy much more space and require temperature controlled room.</p>
    <h3>Mainframe Computer</h3>
    <p>This computer are also largest, fastest and perhaps one of the most expensive computer. Super computer are much more powerful and expensive but they are similar in size with mainframe computers. These computers have high processing unit and large storage capacity. This computer have multiple terminal. This computer can do big capacity of processing tasks such as population census, agro census, SLC result processing, governmental offices, industries etc. The first computer bought in Nepal in 2028 BS was IBM 1401, which was also a mainframe computer. This computer was bought in Nepal for population counting. Moreover, second computer bought in Nepal was ICL 2950/10 in 2038 BS which was also a mainframe computer brought for same purpose.</p>
    <h3>Mini Computer</h3>
    <p>This computer are smaller than mainframe computer and are more powerful and expensive compare with micro-computer. They use terminal and are connected with more than 50 terminal at a time. Hence, it can handle much more amount of input and output than micro computer. The capability of mini computer is somewhere in between mainframe and micro computer. So, they are often called mid-range computer. This computer are used for medium size business, industries, universities, banks due to easy operation than mainframe computer. Eg, Data general, NECK, MAGNUM</p>
    <h3>Micro Computer</h3>
    <p>These are the smallest computer develop till date they use micro-processor as their major processing unit. Hence, they are called micro-computers. This computer are small and low cost digital computer. They are also called home computer or personal computer. This days we can find various micro computer that has various processing speed, storage, capacity and size according to cost. They are normally used in office, home, school, shop etc. Micro Computer are also found in various shape and size. They are desktop, Laptop and palmtop.</p>
<h3>a. Desktop:</h3> They are the personal computer which use micro-processor as a single chip processing unit normally called CPU whose size are so small that they accommodate in a desk of a user. Desktop also have various range of personal computer having several processing speed, storage, capacity and other features. This computer are out popular computer this days. So that, they are used in various commercial field such as school, home, office, business and so on.

<h4>b. Laptop: </h4>This computer are highly portable micro computers  and can be carried from one place to another easily like briefcase. They are so small that they can be fixed in a lap of a user and hence they are called laptop. They are mostly popular among traveller and the business man. We have to move from one place to another place for work and different reasons. Since, laptop comes with battery backup, we don’t need to have direct A.C. supply. So, we can use without direct connection of electricity. It high reliability, portability and flexibility.

<h4>c. Palmtop/Handheld:</h4> These are the most portable and smallest device that are develop till date. They are so highly portable that they can be carried easily inside the pocket of the user. Due to small in size they can be adjusted within the palm of the user. So, they are called Palmtop. Several tablets, PDA (Personal Digital Assistant), smartphones are commonly used palmtop these days. This device also gave huge range of application ranging from game playing, internet surfing, and other official needs and requirement. This device also comes with battery backup.
