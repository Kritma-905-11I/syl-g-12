 <h2>1. What is Information Technology? Describe it with its social impacts</h2>
    <p>Information Technology is a modern concept or methodology of communication. It is the combined form of Information and Communication Technology, which is highly used for the information flow and in many other fields. IT has made the world closer day by day. One can easily send and receive the message throughout the world within a second. It has been widely used in education, industry, banks, research centers, hospitals, etc. It is being used as a learning and teaching tool in the education sector. Distant learning has become possible due to the advancement of IT. It has been highly used in the industries to control the quantity and quality of the product. It is equally used for management in hospitals and for the treatment of patients. IT is being used in the sector of animation and other entertainment. Scientists can use computers or IT for their research and experiments. Space technology has become possible due to IT. Thus, it has a positive impact on society. However, it also has some negative impacts, such as the increasing number of cybercrimes. Cyber criminals can easily steal others’ information or data, disclose other secrets, and spread viruses across the network, disturbing social peace and security.</p>

    <h3>Information Security</h3>
    <p>As we know, in a network or cyberspace there is always a threat of cyber-attacks, which may lead to the loss and damage of our precious data and information. It is always necessary to be aware of such malicious activities. We need to adopt different measures while using computers to avoid such intentional and accidental activities. Thus, information security refers to the process of protecting our network infrastructure from unauthorized access, misuse, modification, destruction, or any malfunction. We can use several physical and software preventive measures to protect ourselves from such unethical activities. Information security helps create a secure environment for computers, users, and programs.</p>

    <p>Information security can mitigate security threats and attacks. A security threat is a possible danger that might cause unwanted activities in our computer system to breach security and cause harm, whereas a security attack is an attempt to gain unauthorized access to destroy, expose, steal, or alter valuable data and information. These attacks can be triggered by malicious applications such as viruses, spyware, Trojan horses, worms, etc.</p>

    <p>Information security is built around three major objectives:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> It means information is available only for the authorized individual, meaning no individual or system can use or process others' information without proper authorization.</li>
        <li><strong>Integrity:</strong> It indicates the accuracy and completeness of data and information, meaning data and information cannot be tampered with without proper authorization.</li>
        <li><strong>Availability:</strong> It means information must always be available as per the user's requirement. It generally refers to accessing valuable data and information whenever needed and within no time.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Cryptography</h3>
    <p>Cryptography is derived from the Greek word, which means “Secret writing.” Cryptography is the art and science of hiding information. It provides security for information. It is used for providing secure communication between individuals, government agencies, and military forces. Cryptography mostly refers to encryption and decryption. Encryption is the process of converting plaintext (a message) into an unreadable format so that anyone who tries to see the message cannot read the original message. The plaintext is converted into unreadable text using a special algorithm and keys. This unreadable text is called ciphertext. The ciphertext is then converted back into a readable form through the process of decryption. Decryption is the reverse process of encryption. Sometimes, encryption is also termed as encoding or enciphering, and its reverse process, decryption, is also termed as decoding or deciphering.</p>

    <h2>2. What is Digital Divide?</h2>
    <p>Digital Divide is the term used for the gap between computer-literate and illiterate people. It is a division between technical and non-technical human resources in the field. IT is modern technology, and for its use, one must have sound knowledge of computers. However, there are still a great number of people who do not know how to operate computers or understand computer-related terms. This difference or gap is called the digital divide. The term first came into practice in the mid-1990s by political speeches and news media. This division is increasing day by day between urban and rural populations, the educated and uneducated, the rich and the poor, and so on. It has become a global issue, and governments are trying to bridge this gap.</p>

    <h2>3. What are the computer ethics or cyber ethics?</h2>
    <p>Computer ethics, or cyber ethics, refers to a set of moral principles or codes of conduct that computer professionals should strictly follow. The intention of computer or cyber ethics is to prevent criminal activities through the use of computers. The following are examples of computer ethics:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Do not use others' passwords</li>
        <li>Do not steal others' information</li>
        <li>Do not use computers to harm others</li>
        <li>Do not disclose others' secrecy</li>
        <li>Do not spread viruses in the network</li>
        <li>Do not copy licensed software that you have not paid for</li>
        <li>Do not alter others' data</li>
        <li>Do not take possession of other people's intellectual property</li>
        <li>Do not misuse electronic transactions</li>
        <li>Do not use computers to bear false witness</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. What is cyber crime? List some examples of cyber crimes.</h2>
    <p>Cybercrime refers to the act of misusing computers, the Internet, or other electronic media. As the use of Information Technology increases, cybercrime is also increasing. The following are some examples of cybercrime:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Misuse of computers</li>
        <li>Spreading viruses</li>
        <li>Stealing others' information</li>
        <li>Pirating licensed software</li>
        <li>Disclosing others' secrecy</li>
        <li>Misuse of electronic transactions and media</li>

        <li>Alteration of others' data without permission</li>
        <li>Spying on others' information</li>
        <li>Cracking or hacking</li>
        <li>Password guessing</li>
        <li>Salami saving and data diddling</li>
        <li>Forgery</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>5. What is Cyber Law? Define and write some provisions of it.</h2>
    <p>The law regarding the use of computers is called Cyber Law. It focuses on the misuse of computers, the Internet, and other electronic media used for information flow. Cyber ethics suggest not committing computer crimes or cybercrimes, while cyber law defines the punishment for violations of laws or cyber principles. Cyber law supports cyber ethics. The Government of Nepal issued the Cyber Law on 11th Falgun, 2061 (18th March 2005) as "The Electronic Transaction Ordinance, 2005".</p>
