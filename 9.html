      <h2>PAST PAPER Q/A OF DBMS</h2>

      <h2>1. What is Database and DBMS? List out the advantages and disadvantages of DBMS.</h2>
      <p>A database is an organized collection of data that is stored and accessed electronically. It allows data to be efficiently retrieved, managed, and updated. Databases are used in various applications, from websites and mobile apps to banking systems and school management software.</p>
      <p>A Database Management System (DBMS) is software that interacts with users, applications, and the database itself to capture and analyze data. It helps users create, manage, and manipulate databases without needing to know how the data is physically stored. Examples of DBMS: MySQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc.</p>

      <p>
        <h3>Advantages of DBMS:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Data Redundancy Control</strong> – Prevents duplication of data by storing data in one central location.</li>
          <li><strong>Data Integrity and Accuracy</strong> – Ensures consistent and accurate data by enforcing rules and constraints.</li>
          <li><strong>Data Security</strong> – Provides user-based access control to protect sensitive data.</li>
          <li><strong>Backup and Recovery</strong> – Offers automatic backup and recovery options in case of system failure.</li>
          <li><strong>Data Sharing</strong> – Multiple users can access the database simultaneously without conflict.</li>
          <li><strong>Data Independence</strong> – Changes in data structure do not affect the application programs.</li>
          <li><strong>Efficient Query Processing</strong> – Allows quick retrieval and processing of data using SQL or other query languages.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Disadvantages of DBMS:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>High Cost</strong> – Installation, setup, and maintenance of DBMS software and hardware can be expensive.</li>
          <li><strong>Complexity</strong> – Requires skilled professionals to design, manage, and maintain databases.</li>
          <li><strong>Performance Overhead</strong> – Large DBMS systems can slow down due to processing overhead.</li>
          <li><strong>Size and Storage</strong> – DBMS systems require significant memory and storage.</li>
          <li><strong>Risk of Data Loss</strong> – Although backups are available, improper handling or attacks can still cause data loss or corruption.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h2>2. Differentiate between file processing system and DBMS. Give at least four points.</h2>
      <p>
        <h3>Difference between File Processing System and DBMS:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Storage:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>File Processing System:</strong> Data is stored in separate files for each application.</li>
              <li><strong>DBMS:</strong> Data is stored in a centralized database accessible by multiple applications.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Redundancy:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>File Processing System:</strong> High data redundancy and inconsistency.</li>
              <li><strong>DBMS:</strong> Reduces redundancy and maintains consistency.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Security:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>File Processing System:</strong> Difficult to implement security and access control.</li>
              <li><strong>DBMS:</strong> Provides strong security features like access control and user permissions.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Query Support:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>File Processing System:</strong> No support for complex queries; data access is manual or sequential.</li>
              <li><strong>DBMS:</strong> Supports complex queries using SQL and advanced data operations.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h2>3.Explain the different models of DBMS with advantages and disadvantages.</h2>
      <p>
        <h3>Different Models of DBMS</h3>

        <h2>1. Hierarchical Model</h2>
        <p>This model organizes data in a tree-like structure with a single root and multiple levels of related records.</p>
        <strong>Advantages:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Easy to understand and use.</li>
          <li>Efficient for queries with a predictable hierarchy.</li>
          <li>Data integrity is maintained due to parent-child relationships.</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Disadvantages:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Complex to reorganize or modify structure.</li>
          <li>Redundancy may occur if relationships are many-to-many.</li>
          <li>Not flexible for dynamic or changing relationships.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Network Model</h2>
        <p>This model represents data as records connected through links (pointers), allowing many-to-many relationships.</p>
        <strong>Advantages:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>More flexible than the hierarchical model.</li>
          <li>Efficient for complex relationships among data.</li>
          <li>Faster data access using pointers.</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Disadvantages:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Complex structure and navigation.</li>
          <li>Requires detailed knowledge of the links for querying.</li>
          <li>Harder to maintain and modify.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Relational Model</h2>
        <p>Data is organized in tables (relations) with rows and columns. Most widely used model today.</p>
        <strong>Advantages:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Simple and easy to understand.</li>
          <li>Flexible and powerful querying using SQL.</li>
          <li>Reduces data redundancy and ensures consistency.</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Disadvantages:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Performance can be slower for very large databases.</li>
          <li>Requires complex joins for multi-table queries.</li>
          <li>Can consume more memory for relational operations.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Object-Oriented Model</h2>
        <p>Data is represented as objects, similar to object-oriented programming languages.</p>
        <strong>Advantages:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Supports complex data types like images, videos, and user-defined types.</li>
          <li>Encapsulation and inheritance increase reusability and organization.</li>
          <li>Better mapping between application and database objects.</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Disadvantages:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>More complex to design and understand.</li>
          <li>Not as widely supported as relational model.</li>
          <li>Can be slower for simple data operations.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h2>What is a relational database? How is it different from other database models?</h2>
      <p>
        <h3>What is a Relational Database?</h3>
        <p>A <strong>relational database</strong> is a type of database that stores data in <strong>tables</strong> (also called <em>relations</em>), made up of rows and columns. Each row is a record, and each column is a field or attribute. Tables can be linked using <strong>foreign keys</strong> to establish relationships between data.</p>
        <p>Relational databases use <strong>SQL (Structured Query Language)</strong> for storing, updating, and querying data.</p>
        <p><strong>Examples:</strong> MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, SQLite.</p>

   <h3>5. What is Data Redundancy? How does DBMS help in reducing it?</h3>

  <p><strong>Data Redundancy</strong> refers to the unnecessary duplication of data within a database or data storage system. It occurs when the same piece of data is stored in multiple places, which can lead to inconsistency, increased storage costs, and difficulty in maintaining data.</p>

  <p><strong>How DBMS Reduces Data Redundancy:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Centralized Data Storage:</strong> DBMS stores all data in a centralized database, eliminating the need to store the same data in multiple files or locations.</li>
    <li><strong>Normalization:</strong> DBMS uses normalization techniques to divide data into related tables and remove repetitive data.</li>
    <li><strong>Foreign Keys:</strong> By linking tables using foreign keys, DBMS avoids storing duplicate data in every table.</li>
    <li><strong>Efficient Design:</strong> DBMS encourages the use of relational schema design, which minimizes redundancy through optimized table structures.</li>
  </ul>
