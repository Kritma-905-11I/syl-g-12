<h2>PAST PAPER Q/A OF DBMS</h2>

<h3>What is Database and DBMS? List out the advantages and disadvantages of DBMS.</h3>
<p>A database is an organized collection of data that is stored and accessed electronically. 
  It allows data to be efficiently retrieved, managed, and updated. Databases are used in various applications, 
  from websites and mobile apps to banking systems and school management software.
  <p>
    A Database Management System (DBMS) is software that interacts with users, applications, and the database itself to capture and analyze data. It helps users create, manage, and manipulate databases without needing to know how the data is physically stored.

Examples of DBMS: MySQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc.
  </p>
  <p>
   <h2>Advantages of DBMS:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Data Redundancy Control</strong> – Prevents duplication of data by storing data in one central location.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Integrity and Accuracy</strong> – Ensures consistent and accurate data by enforcing rules and constraints.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Security</strong> – Provides user-based access control to protect sensitive data.</li>
        <li><strong>Backup and Recovery</strong> – Offers automatic backup and recovery options in case of system failure.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Sharing</strong> – Multiple users can access the database simultaneously without conflict.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Independence</strong> – Changes in data structure do not affect the application programs.</li>
        <li><strong>Efficient Query Processing</strong> – Allows quick retrieval and processing of data using SQL or other query languages.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Disadvantages of DBMS:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>High Cost</strong> – Installation, setup, and maintenance of DBMS software and hardware can be expensive.</li>
        <li><strong>Complexity</strong> – Requires skilled professionals to design, manage, and maintain databases.</li>
        <li><strong>Performance Overhead</strong> – Large DBMS systems can slow down due to processing overhead.</li>
        <li><strong>Size and Storage</strong> – DBMS systems require significant memory and storage.</li>
        <li><strong>Risk of Data Loss</strong> – Although backups are available, improper handling or attacks can still cause data loss or corruption.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

 <strong>(1011)<sub>2</sub></strong> is <strong>(0100)<sub>2</sub></strong>.</p>

<h3>Differentiate between file processing system and DBMS. Give at least four points.</h3>
<p><h2>Difference between File Processing System and DBMS:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Storage:</strong>  
            <ul>
                <li><strong>File Processing System:</strong> Data is stored in separate files for each application.</li>
                <li><strong>DBMS:</strong> Data is stored in a centralized database accessible by multiple applications.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Redundancy:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>File Processing System:</strong> High data redundancy and inconsistency.</li>
                <li><strong>DBMS:</strong> Reduces redundancy and maintains consistency.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Security:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>File Processing System:</strong> Difficult to implement security and access control.</li>
                <li><strong>DBMS:</strong> Provides strong security features like access control and user permissions.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Query Support:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>File Processing System:</strong> No support for complex queries; data access is manual or sequential.</li>
                <li><strong>DBMS:</strong> Supports complex queries using SQL and advanced data operations.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul></p>
<p>For example, if <strong>(1010)<sub>2</sub></strong> is a given number, then:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Its 1's complement is <strong>(0101)<sub>2</sub></strong></li>
    <li>Its 2's complement is <strong>(0101)<sub>2</sub></strong> + <strong>(1)<sub>2</sub></strong> = <strong>(0110)<sub>2</sub></strong></li>
</ul>

<h3>Very Important:</h3>
<h4>Subtraction using 1's and 2's Complement</h4>
<p>Rules to remember (let us consider, question be X - Y):</p>

<h3>Using 1's Complement</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Calculate 1's complement of 'Y'.</li>
    <li>Add the result of step 1 with 'X'.</li>
    <li>If there is an extra bit, remove that extra bit and add it to the remaining bit.</li>
    <li>If there is no extra bit, find 1's complement of the result in step 2 and add a negative sign.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Using 2's Complement</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Calculate 2's complement of 'Y'.</li>
    <li>Add the result of step 1 with 'X'.</li>
    <li>If there is an extra bit, remove that extra bit.</li>
    <li>If there is no extra bit, find 2's complement of the result in step 2 and add a negative sign.</li>
</ol>


<h2>Introduction: Boolean Logic</h2>

<p>Boolean Algebra is the algebra of logic, which deals with the study of binary variables and logical operations. As all data is represented in terms of binary values, we need to manipulate those values by using certain rules and expressions, which we can do through Boolean algebra. It is the most common and basic method to analyze and design logic circuits. It was introduced by an English mathematician George Boole. In Boolean algebra, the variables can have only one of the two possible values: 0 and 1 (False or True). Every modern digital computer understands either of these two values.</p>

<h4>Boolean Algebra:</h4>
<p>It is the algebra of logic, which accepts either of the two possible values, 0 and 1, and generates a result through logical relationships and operations.</p>

<h4>Boolean Variable:</h4>
<p>Boolean variables are entities that have either 0 or 1 and denote some specific operation. Simply, it is an entity in Boolean algebra that can only have either of the two possible values. These variables are denoted by A, B, P, Q, X, Y, Z, etc.</p>

<h4>Boolean Function (Logic Functions):</h4>
<p>A Boolean function is an expression formed by binary variables, binary operators such as AND, OR, NOT, parentheses, and an equal sign. For a given set of values, this Boolean function gives either 0 or 1 as a result.</p>

<p>Let us consider the following example:</p>

<p><strong>F = XYZ’ + XY</strong></p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>F</strong> is a Boolean function.</li>
    <li><strong>X, Y, Z</strong> are Boolean variables.</li>
    <li><strong>X, Y, Z, Z’</strong> are also literals.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Truth Table:</h4>
<p>A truth table is a table that represents the input-output relationship of the binary variables for each logical gate. It shows the relationship between input and output in tabular form. A truth table represents the results of logical operations on all possible combinations of logical values.</p>

<h4>Boolean Operator and Operands:</h4>
<p>Operators are the symbols that define specific operations. The three basic operators used in Boolean algebra are AND, OR, and NOT. Every other operation can be expressed in terms of these basic operations. For example, the NOR operator is a combination of NOT and OR operators.</p>

<h5>The Three Basic Operators:</h5>
<ul>
    <li><strong>AND</strong></li>
    <li><strong>OR</strong></li>
    <li><strong>NOT</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>a. AND Operators:</h3>
 AND operator is represented by “.” So, A AND B is represented by (A.B) . The  result of the AND operation is exactly same as simple arithmetic multiplication. That means result will be high (1) only when both the inputs are high. Note: A AND B can also represented bu  AˆB or AnB. Truth table of AND operation is given below

<h4>Truth Table for Y = A.B</h4>

<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <th>A</th>
    <th>B</th>
    <th>Y = A.B</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h3>b. OR Operator:</h3>
 OR operator is represented by “+” So, A OR B is represented by (A+B) . The  result of the OR operation is exactly same as simple arithmetic addition. That means result will be low (0) if and only both the inputs are low. Note: A OR B can also represented bu  AvB or AuB. Truth table of AND operation is given below
<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <th>A</th>
    <th>B</th>
    <th>Y = A + B</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h3>c. NOT Operator: </h3>
NOT operator is represented by “-” or “ ’ ”  So, NOT operation of an operands A is represented as A’ . NOT operation performs negation. That means it will give high output (1) for low input (0) and vice-versa. Truth table of NOT operation is given below
<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <th>A</th>
    <th>A'</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>0</td>
  </tr>
</table>
